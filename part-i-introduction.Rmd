# Bayes' theorem

> If there be two subsequent events, the probability of the second b/N and the probability of both together P/N, and it being first discovered that the second event has also happened, from hence I guess that the first event has also happened, the probability I am right is P/b.

With symbols<sup>1</sup>

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)} {P(B)}$$
- $P(B)$: probability that the second event happens.
- $P(A \cap B)$: probability that both events happens.
- $P(A)$: probability that the first event happens.

# Bayes' theorem

Considering Bayes' theorem again

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)} {P(B)}$$

We know that $P(A \cap B) = P(B \cap A)$, since "A and B happen" is the same as "B and A happen". Hence, we also have

$$P(B|A) = \frac{P(B \cap A)}{P(A)} = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(A)}$$

By some replacement, it follows that

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$

For a random person taken from the population, what is the probability of disease (event $A$) given positive test (event $B$)?

- Sensitivity: $P(B|A)$. 
- Base rate: $P(A)$. 
- Positive test: $P(B) = P(B|\bar{A}) + P(B|A) = \{1-P(\bar{B}|\bar{A})\} + P(B|A)$.
  - $P(\bar{B}|\bar{A})$ is the specificity.

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{1-P(\bar{B}|\bar{A}) + P(B|A)}$$
